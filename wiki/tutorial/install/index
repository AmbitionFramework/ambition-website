# Installing the Ambition Web Framework
<br />


## Installing on Specific Operating Systems

* [[tutorial/install/ubuntu1304|Ubuntu 13.04-14.10]]
* [[tutorial/install/ubuntu1210|Ubuntu 12.10]]
* [[tutorial/install/fedora18|Fedora 18]]
* [[tutorial/install/freebsd9|FreeBSD 9-10]]
* [[tutorial/install/osx107|Mac OS X 10.7-10.10 (with MacPorts)]]


## What you'll need
Ambition is written in and for the Vala programming language, so you will need a computer capable of compiling Vala applications. Ambition has been successfully installed on Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X. A Windows installer and toolset is on the roadmap, but has successfully been compiled and used under Cygwin. The full requirements are as follows:

* A UNIX-like operating system and shell (Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, Mac OS X)
* GCC 4.2 or higher
* Vala/valac 0.16 or higher
* CMake 2.8 or higher
* glib-2.0
* libgee-0.8
* libgio-2.0
* libjson-glib-1.0
* libreadline
* libsoup-1.0

## Installing a release version from source

Release versions of Ambition are installed similarly to other open source projects utilizing CMake. Download the latest release from our downloads page, and extract to a temporary directory of your choice.

* Change to the extracted directory.
* Now, execute "`make`" to build Ambition.
* Execute "`make test`" to verify Ambition built correctly on your system.
* Execute "`make install`" under sudo or as a root user to install the Ambition libraries on your machine.

## Installing from git

Installing from the git repository is very similar to installing a release version from source. Keep in mind that the master branch may not be fully tested at all times, so it isn't recommended to run in a production environment.

* Clone the master repository to your machine.
* Make a directory called "`build`", and change to that directory.
* Execute "`cmake ..`" to generate makefiles with default options.
* Now, execute "`make`" to build Ambition.
* Execute "`make check`" to verify Ambition built correctly on your system.
* Execute "`make install`" under sudo or as a root user to install the Ambition libraries on your machine.
